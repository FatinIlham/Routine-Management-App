# University Routine Manage App
Scheduler is an android-based class schedule application for Varendra University. The application of class schedules is the key to a well-managed, organized classroom. Students' class schedules allow them to quickly complete daily responsibilities that are required of both the teacher and the students. There is also a class cancellation option for teachers here. There is also the option to add an extra class and search for an empty classroom. Finally, our project has the potential to serve as a model for the entire department.

In that project, we are creating an android-based application that will provide up-to-date daily class times, identify overlap classes, add extra class options, search for empty class rooms, and collect information.
